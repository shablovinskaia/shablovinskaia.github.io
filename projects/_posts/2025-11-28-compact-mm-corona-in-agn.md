## Compact mm emission — state of the art

It has long been theorized that the hot, magnetized X-ray corona above the accretion disk in active galactic nuclei may produce synchrotron emission at millimeter wavelengths. However, only with the advent of high-sensitivity mm-interferometers such as ALMA we are now obtaining the first compelling observational evidence supporting this hypothesis. Recent studies have detected compact, unresolved mm sources in radio-quiet AGNs with (highly likely) synchrotron spectra, strongly pointing to corona-based mm emission rather than extended jets or star-forming regions.

## Results so far 🛠️

- **X-ray / mm monitoring.** Coordinated monitoring campaigns combining X-ray observations with ALMA to track correlated variability — aiming to understand whether mm emission from coronae varies in tandem with X-ray flux, which would support a common origin. In the focus: radio-quiet Sy1 IC 4329A, simultaneously monitored by NICER, XMM-Newton, and Swift in X-rays and ALMA. No correlated variations found, but look at the splendid variability at 100 GHz!

- **mm polarimetry of radio-quiet AGNs.** For the first time, we carried out a millimeter polarimetric monitoring of three radio-quiet AGNs — NGC 3783, MCG-3-23-16, and NGC 4945 — with ALMA at 100 GHz. If the mm emission truly comes from a synchrotron process, it should carry polarization. That would be a direct way to catch magnetic fields at just a few gravitational radii from a supermassive black hole! And yet… space doesn’t always cooperate. All three AGNs appear completely unpolarized.
But the story doesn’t end there — powerful magnetic fields might still be in charge via extreme Faraday rotation, wiping out the polarization. See more: **[Shablovinskaia et al. (2025)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...703A..82S/abstract)**

## Why this matters

Understanding mm-emission from coronae in radio-quiet AGNs may:

- Reveal **magnetic field strength and geometry** in innermost regions near SMBHs.  
- Provide constraints on **non-thermal particle populations** in coronae, important for high-energy processes (e.g. neutrino, gamma-ray production).  
- Clarify whether coronae — and not only jets — can serve as sites of **efficient particle acceleration**.  
- Open **new diagnostics** to distinguish between corona and jet origins of mm/radio emission in AGN of different types.

## Future plans & open questions

- Extend the sample: observe a larger set of radio-quiet AGNs to assess how common compact mm coronae are.  
- Multi-epoch polarimetry: track changes in polarization to infer magnetic field evolution and possibly detect transient events (e.g. coronal flares).  
- Joint modeling: combine spectral, timing and polarization data to build physical models of coronae (size, magnetic field, electron energy distribution).  
- Cross-check with neutrino alerts: explore whether coronae could be sources of high-energy neutrinos, especially in non-jetted AGNs.
