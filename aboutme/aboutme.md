I am an astrophysicist working on optical polarization and millimeter emission
in active galactic nuclei, focusing on particle acceleration in the X-ray corona
and its connection to the base of relativistic jets.
My work bridges radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN populations
to understand what triggers jet launching and whether strong acceleration
can occur without large-scale jets.

Currently: Humboldt Fellowship at Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy, Bonn, Germany
