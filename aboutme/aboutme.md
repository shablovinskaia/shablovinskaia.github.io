I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the **Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy** in Bonn, where I study **compact millimetre emission from active galactic nuclei** and its connection to the **X-ray corona**. My work focuses on particle acceleration, magnetic fields, and the physics of the innermost regions around supermassive black holes.

Before moving to Germany, I worked as a postdoc at **Universidad Diego Portales** in Santiago, Chile, leading ALMA projects on **mm/X-ray variability** and **millimetre polarimetry of radio-quiet AGNs**. I completed my **Ph.D. at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of RAS**, specializing in optical image- and spectropolarimetry of active galaxies *(and I'm still in love with it!)*.

My scientific interests include **AGN central regions**, **mm and optical polarimetry**, **X-ray corona physics**, and **AGN variability** across timescales.
