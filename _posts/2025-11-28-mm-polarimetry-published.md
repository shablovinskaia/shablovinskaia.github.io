A long road has finally come to its destination — our paper **“ALMA 3 mm polarimetry of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei”** is now published in *A&A*! 
This project began as an idea of Prof. Claudio Ricci at the very start of my first postdoc at Universidad Diego Portales in Chile, and it has travelled a long scientific path since then.

We submitted an ALMA proposal, waited, and finally received the Band 3 polarimetric data in autumn 2023. At that time, the community was actively debating the nature of compact mm emission in radio-quiet AGNs:
- first discovered as an **mm excess** by *[[Inoue & Doi (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...869..114I/abstract)]*,
- then seen in **90%+** of AGNs in ALMA Band 6 surveys *[[Kawamuro et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...87K/abstract)]*,
- and finally found to correlate tightly with **X-rays** *[[Ricci et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...952L..28R/abstract)]*.

Was this mysterious mm bump **synchrotron emission** from the hot, magnetized X-ray corona?  Or was it something else — extended jets, thermal emission of outflows? Polarimetry offered a straightforward diagnostic: if the millimeter emission originates from a compact synchrotron corona, it should be strongly polarized; if part of an extended jet contributes, the polarization would still be detectable but reduced by turbulence; and if the emission is thermal, no polarization would be expected at all.


By the time the ALMA observations arrived, we had already ruled out thermal emission for several AGNs. So everything hinged on one question:

## **Is the mm emission polarized?**

And the answer was… **no.**  All three AGNs show no detectable linear polarization, only upper limits. The sole exception is NGC 3783, where we find a polarized blob ~20 pc from the nucleus — likely connected with an outflow rather than the corona.

Still, this *does not* rule out a coronal synchrotron origin.
If the magnetic field is disordered, or if the Faraday rotation measure reaches **extreme values** — very plausible for an electron density of *~10¹¹ cm⁻³* — then **complete depolarization** is natural.

So the mystery deepens rather than ends.  
But now we finally have the observational foundation to push toward realistic physical models of mm emission and magnetic fields in AGN coronae.
