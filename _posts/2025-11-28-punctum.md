title: Punctum — a strange new polarized mm source in NGC 4945

A very unusual chapter of my work on mm emission has just unfolded — we have discovered a tiny, incredibly polarized object in the centre of NGC 4945. We call it **Punctum**.

This source first appeared in our ALMA Band 3 data almost like a joke: a single unresolved speck, *100 times fainter* than the bright active nucleus of the galaxy, and yet showing **~50% linear polarization** — 
an absurdly high value even for a jet, a pulsar, or a fresh supernova remnant. 

*(Ironically, this is exactly the kind of highly polarized signal we would **love** to see coming from an AGN corona — but the Universe clearly has a sense of humor.)*  

And still, Punctum looks like none of them.

What makes it even stranger is its invisibility. There is no trace of Punctum in X-rays, no hint in radio maps, no optical signature. Outside of ALMA’s millimetre vision, it simply does not exist. If we had not looked at NGC 4945 in *polarization*, we would have completely missed it.

So what is it? Most likely, Punctum radiates synchrotron emission — fast electrons spiralling in a strong, ordered magnetic field — but none of the usual astrophysical suspects fit all of its properties. It may be a rare, short-lived phase of a known object… or something entirely new that we’ve never seen before.
The unusual combination of **extreme polarization + extreme compactness + total lack of multi-wavelength counterparts** sets Punctum apart from known classes of sources.

We’re preparing follow-up ALMA observations at other frequencies and planning to look for infrared signatures (hello, JWST!) that might reveal whether Punctum hides dust, emission lines, or anything that could betray its identity.

The funniest part? This little speck — faint enough to vanish everywhere except mm wavelengths — has already attracted surprising attention from the popular press, including several rather enthusiastic (and occasionally very creative) interpretations in yellow and semi-yellow media. Apparently, people really like mysterious bright dots.

The Punctum's paper is already published in A&A!
